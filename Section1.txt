Section 1


1.	You are given a series 1,2,3 … recognize the pattern and write a small piece of php code to print out this series up until infinity (infinite loop).

 $x = 0 ;
While(true){
  $x++;
  echo $x . ", ";
}

 	 	
2.	You are given a series 1,3,6,10 … recognize the pattern and write a small piece of php code to print out this series up until infinity (infinite loop).

 $x = 0;
 $y = 0;
While(true){
    $y++;
    $x = $x + $y;
    echo $x . ", ";
}

3.	Explain what it means to define a class as abstract:

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated, but can be extended to.  


4.	Briefly explain the difference between private and protected in terms of OOP:

Private can only be accessed inside that class.
Protected can be accessed by that class and by the inherited classes derived form there.


5.	Define the following php functions:

•	explode

Explode is used to break up a string into an array where the pharse/character is present in the string.

•	stripos

stripos just finds the the first occurance of your specified phrase in the sting given
  
•	rtrim

Right trim: trims a specified amount of characters on the right side of a string 



•	require
includes the specified file into your scope 


•	require_once
includes the specified file into your scope only once. This resolves errors of including it multiple times. 

    
 6. What would the following code output:

for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
	echo $i;
	continue;
}

    01234




     7. What would the following code output:

do {
	echo “1”;
	
	continue;

	echo “2”;

	break;

} while (false);

1 (the Continue keyword progreses the do to the while) 

	 	
8. You are given 2 tables in a database, a user table and a company table.

User
id
username
company_id



Company
id
name

	 	 	
Write a query to give the following result :

user_name	company_name
Pete	Pzero

MySQL:

SELECT User.username as "user_name" , Company.name as "company_name"
From User
INNER JOIN Company
ON User.company_id = Company.id
WHERE username = 'Pete' AND name = "Pzero"


10. Briefly describe what JSON is and what php functions you would use to make use of JSON on a day to day basis:

JSON is a text object that is generally used for sending information between applications. It is used as the standard for most web based API's.
json_encode and json_decode.
